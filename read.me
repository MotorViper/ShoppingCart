Please see the business case file in the docs folder for versions of software etc.
The overallTest in TillTest shows the functionality working.
I have also added a simple GUI using the classes as an extra.

Things I would have preferred to do given the time.
1. Make the prices configurable through a properties file (prices go up over time).
2. Make it possible to add offers through configuration.
However this also goes against the idea of simplest solution, which I admit I haven't completely stuck to anyway. However
simplest solution does not really give an indication of how I can write code, particularly w.r.t. SOLID principles so I
have added a few extras.
